## Getting Started


This program compares a user input password to common password validation rules, and compares
the input to a list of most commonly used passwords, returning to the user if the password is 
considered valid, and if not it gives the user the reasons why/what requirements are not met. 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources. Contains main App.java
- `files`: folder containing the packages for the app. Found within `src` folder
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin`.

> `.vscode/settings.json` contains folder structure related settings.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
